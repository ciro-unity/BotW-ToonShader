## Unity version
The Unity version used is 2021.2.5, with URP 12.1.2.

## Production-readiness
The shader is provides as-is, and its production readiness is not guaranteed.
Some features missing are:
- The ability to bake
- Support for secondary lights (point, spot)
- Reflection probe support

The project is born to act as initial inspiration. Any additional needed feature will need to be implemented by you.

## Usage
You can refer to my two talks on Shader Graph from Unite Copenhagen 2019 to learn how to use this repository, and for general tips:
- [Shader Graph: Ready for Production](https://youtu.be/L6mU2rkT5To)
- [Creating a Stylised Toon Shader with Shader Graph](https://youtu.be/DOLE4nrK97g) (this is a breakdown of the shader contained here)

The shader can be freely used for commercial purposes, no need for credit (though it would be nice).
Assets included are part of a Unity asset pack (see license for details).
